  <h1> About GoRide </h1>




  <p class="text1"> We are a small group of mates who have gathered together to create a data base of great trails within New Zealand.
      Our goal is to connect people with tracks. So creating a well designed webpage which is easy to use and explores different trails NZ has to offer.



  </p>




<h2> Just look at what NZ has to offer. </h2>
